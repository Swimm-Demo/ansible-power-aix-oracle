# Configuration Overview

Configuration refers to the setup and customization of variables and parameters necessary for the installation and deployment of Oracle Single Instance database <SwmToken path="vars/powervc_oracle_params.yml" pos="26:7:7" line-data="ora_parent_dir: &quot;/orabin/19c&quot;">`19c`</SwmToken> on AIX systems. It involves defining various settings such as virtual machine details, storage templates, network configurations, and disk sizes specific to the <SwmToken path="vars/powervc_oracle_params.yml" pos="4:18:18" line-data="# Below are the variables that are specific to PowerVC">`PowerVC`</SwmToken> environment.

Additionally, configuration includes specifying the locations and types of Oracle binaries, user and group details, and filesystem parameters required for the Oracle deployment. The configuration also covers optional settings like NFS details for fileset installation and parameters for using standard NIM filesystems.

Furthermore, it involves setting up Oracle-specific parameters such as SID, passwords, character sets, and ASM disk group configurations.
